</p><p>Journalists each day structure this chaos, so that the public receives it sorted out and neatly packaged into stories, the same day on radio, television or online and the next day in newspapers.
</p><p>Since then, news has been an essential part of our civilization. News inform the public about events that are around them and may affect them. News also serves as an entertainment; to provide a distraction of information about other places people are unable to get to or have little influence over. News can make people feel connected too.
</p><p>But with the advent of the media, the popularity of the habit of reading news has become very less. According to Michael Barthel’s “Newspaper: Fact Sheet” in his research on newspaper sales at the Pew Research Center, weekday and Sunday newspaper circulation fell approximately 7% and 4% respectively in 2015, the biggest decline since 11% and 8% in 2010. Although a rise in 2013 displays a make up for a portion of the losses, the decline resumed afterwards, and circulation went down much more rapidly in 2014 and 2015 compared to the losses from 2004 to 2010. 
</p><p>Despite all the numbers, statistics and reality of what’s happening today, Camille and Mareia believed in the effectiveness and necessity that persists with the existence of news. The negative circumstance even gave them the motivation to create ways how people should look and respect the contribution of news in bettering the society.

Her interest in those recreations strengthen and flourished when she started to join the debate team in her junior high school years. Her delight from reading fantasies of imaginary people turned to the curiosity of reading the truth of real people and her astonishment of writing make-believe stories of her little characters turned into writing and telling the voices of true people. Knowing what’s more behind the surface of the society made her want to let everybody understand that things are more than how it seems to be.</span></p></div>

Since then, she started to collect books regarding obscure and hidden crimes and she tried to find the holes about the justice system and about the type of investigation the law enforcement agencies had been doing entirely wrong that leads to these unsolved cases.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Camille’s love for debate and Mareia’s commitment for true crime are the inspiration behind the website G-NEWS (Generating Notable Events, Weather and Sports). G-NEWS is an online platform wherein people can read news on-the-go, very conveniently through any technological devices online or offline. G-NEWS’ purpose is to provide an avenue for people to engage into reading news again because it is now very easy to do, since all the news published in the website are sorted out from different categories and different dates. Another thing is that, one of the categories people can choose to in the website is called “Crimes”. In this specific category, the authors feature stories that are usually not being reported through media like the television or the radio, but are really relevant because it is not yet solved, the issue is very alarming and the justice hasn’t been rightfully granted. Also, news, videos and interviews to be presented in the website are not limited because the authors extend the capability of the person who will be visiting the website to publish his own news story and brought it up to the world after several, fact checking. Last thing that is very special regarding this website is its “Unfolded Stories” feature. In this specific aspect of the site, the authors cultivate and update stories from different years that seems to be forgotten by many due to lack of conversation about it for the longest time. The authors want to remind people that there are so many social issues that needs to be talked about and that they should never just stop but interrupt and be disturb.</p></div>
