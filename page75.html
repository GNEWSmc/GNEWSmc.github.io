    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">It was a sunny and cloudless morning in Manila on May 15, when mayoral candidate Isko Moreno called for 8 a.m.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">He barely had time to eat, so he didn't have time to rest. He had just been elected the next mayor of Manila, and he had to meet the people who would carry out his dream of peace and order to rebuild the city.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">In the lobby of the New World Hotel in Malate, he named his most trusted man, Major Rosalino Ibay Jr, Chief of the District Intelligence and Operations Unit, a veteran agent, and his childhood friend.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Ibay arrived on the dot, and just as he found his seat, was instructed by Moreno to call the chief of the Manila Police District (MPD), Brigadier General Vicente Danao Jr.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">When Danao arrived with his entourage and settled down, Moreno pointed to Ibay and told the one-star general, "Gusto ko siyang maupo bilang chef ng pulis ko sa Manila City Hall (I want him to sit as the chief of police in Manila City Hall)." 
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Danao was having an idea. Moreno could have had the team he wanted. Finally, Danao said it had been achieved before. He became, after all, the top cop of then-mayor Rodrigo Duterte in Davao City, in charge of what was known as the Special Mayor's Response Team (SMaRT).
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">The Mayor's Unit
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Mayors do not just make up their personal anti-crime team. While the National Police Commission (Napolcom) is responsible for managing the cops, the mayors can not keep the police teams to their own advantage.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">So Danao and Ibay drew up guidelines for the development of SMART. These were decided two weeks after the meeting of the hotel on May 28. The aim of the SMART was clear and set out in a memorandum released by Danao;
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. To intensify the priority program of the City Mayor of Manila, Honorable Mayor Francisco “Isko” Moreno Domagoso against all forms of corruption in the City Government of Manila;
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. To clean the City of Manila from corrupt practices involving police personnel and other law enforcers, and local government officials, both elected and appointed;
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp;
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. To eradicate all criminal activities involving gang/s, organized and syndicated groups operating in the City of Manila;
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. To rescue and save the youth of Manila from all forms of abuses, vices, and illegal activities;
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5.To strictly enforce all City Ordinances, acts punishable under the Revised Penal Code, and all other prohibited acts as may be provided by the laws.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">The SMaRT also investigates walk-in complaints from Manileños and assists in securing the city’s officials.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">But a caveat. Under its general guidelines, the memorandum says, “The administrative and operational control of the SMaRT office shall be directly supervised by the C, DID (Chief, District Intelligence Division) under the office of the District Director.”
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">While SMaRT operates on the agenda of Mayor Moreno, its legitimacy depends on MPD headquarters. Because the team was created under the stewardship of General Danao, it would also only be Danao who could disband them.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">SMaRT is not a monolithic anti-crime group. It is manned by 64 people, consisting of two operations teams, administrative personnel, two deputy chiefs, and its commander, Major Ibay.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Like Moreno, the SMART commander is a proud "Tondo boy" who is hardened by the harsh streets of Moriones. In reality, his decision to wear the blue PNP was sparked by a haunting brush with crime in his own neighborhood.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">"Biktima din tayo ng insidente sa Tondo kung saan nakatanggap ako ng dictator at pumalag ako. Nakatanggap tayo ng 13 stab wounds," Ibay said to Rappler. (I was also the victim of an incident in Tondo, where I stood up to an attacker. I got 13 stab wounds.)
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">For most of his career as a police officer, Ibay worked as an intelligence officer. He's not embarrassed to say he didn't have a head start because he didn't enter the Philippine National Police Academy. But he is one of the most decorated cops who managed to get through the so-called "lateral entrance."
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Under President Rodrigo Duterte’s so-called war on drugs, Ibay was promoted chief of the Manila police's District Police Intelligence Operations Unit, the team that prepares drug lists and joins operations in hunting down drug suspects.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">His proudest achievement for the MPD was busting the Confederate Sentinels Group (CSG), a vigilante group that killed alleged criminals in Tondo. (Rappler earlier reported that there are strong indications that cops outsourced the CSG to carry out killings.)
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Like his bosses, Ibay believes all the drug suspects shot down by cops in the anti-drug campaign fought back and threatened cops' lives, despite the conviction of 3 cops in the killing of Caloocan teenager Kian delos Santos.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">When asked whether it was possible for cops to restrain themselves if there were no life threats, he responded, “Hangga’t wala kasi kayo sa posisyon namin sa sapatos na ginagalawan namin, madaling sabihin yun (As long as you're not in our position and don't walk in our shoes, that's easy for you to say).”
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The team’s exploits, its future</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Under Moreno, Ibay has his drug-busting days behind him. At least for now.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">That Danao would disband the very idea he pitched is far-fetched, especially since he has shared the glory in presenting achievements, which span arrests as wide-reaching as Moreno’s ambitious promises.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Every time SMaRT makes an arrest, Moreno holds a press briefing inside the historic Bulwagang Katipunan of the Manila City Hall, never forgetting to make special mention of Ibay and Danao. Both followed Moreno's lead in presenting suspects, despite a ban from the PNP's national headquarters – part of efforts to curb trials by publicity.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Among the highlights of SMaRT operations are the arrest of the city’s most wanted rape suspect, the arrest of a dog butcher spotted through a social media post, and the arrest of so-called “jumpers” who stole electricity monitors from homes.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">SMaRT also tracked down the gun-toting barangay captain Amado Soriano who went viral on the internet.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">They also guarded and assisted Moreno in his much-publicized clearing operations in Binondo, Recto, and Divisoria.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Moreno would even accompany them in operations, most recently in the shutting down of a gambling arcade posing as an amusement center in Isetann Recto.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Asked why he joined the operation despite the security risk, Moreno said he “means business” in the capital. He also vowed that laws would be applied “equally” under his term.
</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">For Ibay and Moreno, their only goal in working together is to give Manileños something they never grew up with: a city that’s clean and safe for all.</span></p></blockquote></div>
